<p>For the past couple of years, Nebraska fans have had a love/hate relationship with their football team. Since Scott Frost came on as Head Coach in 2018, the Huskers have achieved a total of 15 wins and, prepare yourself, a total of 29 losses.</p>
<p>With 2021 being another rocky season for Nebraska football, the quarterback, Adrian Martinez, was on the front lines of the hate being received. He has now transferred to play at Kansas State, making many Husker fans appreciative, but was he really the issue? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to look at is how Martinez stands next to all of the other QBs in college football.</p>
<p>Nebraska had multiple offensive players suffer injuries throughout the season, leaving Martinez as the Huskers’s biggest offensive weapon. His rushing yards are high and his passing yards… not so high. He did what he could with the situation at hand, seeming to juggle many different positions. A possible, rather big, reason Martinez transferred to Kansas State was to be able to show off his arm.</p>

<p>And, well, if it didn’t look like he rushed the ball all that much in the last graph, this one will change your mind. Let’s put him next to the other QBs in the Big Ten.</p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/01/adrian-martinez/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>He’s No. 1 in something! No. 1 in rushing yards in the Big Ten! Seventh in passing completions, seventh in passing attempts and sixth in passing yards. But again, this is only showing the Big Ten, so it’s nothing too awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>The QBs main job is to pass the ball. No? Where does Martinez rank out in passing percentages amongst the other Big Ten QBs?</p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/01/adrian-martinez/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Although not at the top of the list of the Big Ten QB’s passing percentages, Martinez isn’t at the bottom, which is a win for Husker Nation. His 62% passing percentage was better than expected, but not outrageously impressive.</p>
<p>Given the status of the other offensive players for Nebraska, Adrian Martinez actually didn’t play all too bad. Most Husker fans will say he was the issue, and maybe he was, but he will now wear purple. We’ll have to wait and see what successes (or misfortunes) he’ll experience next season.</p>
