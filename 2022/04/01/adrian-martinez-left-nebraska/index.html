<p>Nebraska football had another tough season and Adrian Martinez was on the front lines of the hate being received. He has now transferred to play at Kansas State, making many Husker fans appreciative, but was he really the issue? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Nebraska had multiple offensive players suffer injuries throughout the season, leaving Martinez as the Huskers’s biggest threat. His rushing yards are high and his passing yards… not so high. He did what he could with the situation at hand, seeming to juggle many different positions. A possible, rather big, reason Martinez transferred to Kansas State was to be able to show off his arm.</p>

<p>And, well, if it didn’t look like he rushed the ball all that much in the last graph, this one will change your mind. He’s No. 1 in something! No. 1 in rushing yards in the Big Ten! Seventh in passing completions, seventh in passing attempts and sixth in passing yards. But again, this is only showing the Big Ten, so it’s nothing too awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Although not at the top of the list of the Big Ten QB’s passing percentages, Martinez isn’t at the bottom, which is a win for Husker Nation. He falls seventh to first and twelfth to last. His numbers are better than expected, but not outrageously impressive.</p>

<p>Given the status of the other offensive players for Nebraska, Adrian Martinez actually didn’t play all too bad. Most Husker fans will say he was the issue, and maybe he was, but he will now wear purple. We’ll have to wait and see what successes (or misfortune) that will bring him next season.</p>
