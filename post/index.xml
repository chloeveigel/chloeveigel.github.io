      <description>For the past couple of years, Nebraska fans have had a love/hate relationship with their football team. Since Scott Frost came on as Head Coach in 2018, the Huskers have achieved a total of 15 wins and, prepare yourself, a total of 29 losses.
With 2021 being another rocky season for Nebraska football, the quarterback, Adrian Martinez, was on the front lines of the hate being received. He has now transferred to play at Kansas State, making many Husker fans appreciative, but was he really the issue?</description>
